# Testing Independence and Conditional Independence in High Dimensions via  Coordinatewise Gaussianization

## Introduction

We propose new statistical tests, in high-dimensional settings, for testing the independence of two random vectors and their conditional independence given a third random vector. The key idea is simple, i.e., we first transform each component variable to standard normal via its marginal empirical distribution, and we then test for  independence and conditional independence of the transformed random vectors using appropriate $L_\infty$-type test statistics.  The new tests are of three advantages: (i) they do not require any moment conditions, (ii) they allow arbitrary dependence structures among the random vectors, and (iii) they allow the dimensions of random vectors diverge at the exponential rates of the sample size.  The critical values of the proposed tests are determined by a computationally efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure. Theoretical analysis shows that the sizes of the proposed tests can be well controlled by the nominal significance level, and the proposed tests are also consistent under certain local alternatives. The finite sample performance of the new tests is illustrated in an extensive numerical simulation and a real data application.
