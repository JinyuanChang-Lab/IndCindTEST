# data_functions

This folder contains the R and Python code used to reproduce the results in **Tables S2** and **S3** for the real data analysis (**Section Q** of the supplementary material).

## Main scripts
 
Running the scripts below requires sourcing the supporting functions in subfolder `data_functions_dep/`. 
The corresponding reproducibility logs generated by the scripts are stored in subfolder `data_results/`.



 


### `ind-realdat_pval.R`

Calculates the p-values of the  proposed independence test on the real data.  
-- Reproducible outputs: `data_results/i68pval.csv` and `data_results/i02pval.csv`.


### `realdata_nn.ipynb`
Reproduces the p-values of the  proposed conditional independence test based on nonparametric regressions (CI-FNN) on the real data in **Table S2**.       
-- Reproducible outputs: `data_results/68pval_nn.csv` and `data_results/02pval_nn.csv`. 

### `cind-realdat_cpval.R`  
Reproduces the p-values of the  proposed conditional independence test based on linear regressions (CI-Lasso) and the competing methods on the real data in **Table S3**.  
-- Reproducible outputs: `data_results/68pval.csv` and `data_results/02pval.csv`.




## Supporting functions

### `data_functions_dep/`  
This subfolder contains scripts that are sourced by the main scripts.   

- `PIND.R` (sourced by `ind-realdat_pval.R`)   
R implementation of the proposed independence test (see Section 3 of the main paper). This script requires sourcing `cv_hat_max_arma.cpp`.

- `Cind_gaussian_fun.py`  (sourced by `realdata_nn.ipynb`)   
Python implementation of the proposed conditional independence test based on nonparametric regressions (CI-FNN, Section 4.1). This script requires sourcing `non_connect_nn.py`.

- `PCIND.R`  (sourced by `cind-realdat_cpval.R`)   
R implementation of the proposed conditional independence test based on linear regressions (CI-Lasso, Section 4.2).   This script requires sourcing `cv_hat_max_arma.cpp`.  


## Reproducible results

### `data_results/`  
  This subfolder stores reproducible outputs, which reproduce the results in **Tables S2** and **S3** in **Section Q** of the supplementary material.
