# Real Data Analysis

This repository includes the codes for "Real Data Analysis" as described in the paper.

## Obtaining p-values:

* To obtain the p-value of the real data using the proposed independence test, run the  MATLAB script  'realdat_ind.m'.

* To obtain the p-value of the real data using the proposed conditional  independence test based on linear regression, run the MATLAB script  'realdat_cin.m'.

* To obtain the p-value of the real data using the proposed conditional  independence test based on nonlinear regression, run the Jupyter Notebook 'realdata.ipynb'.

## Generating the Conditional Dependence Network:

 * To obtain the edges of the Conditional dependence network of the 11 sector  run the  R script  'real_edge.R'. 
 
 * To generate the network figure, run the R script 'plot.R'.
